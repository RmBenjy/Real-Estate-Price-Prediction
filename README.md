# Real Estate Price Prediction
To build an end-to-end Machine Learning model, you first need to train a Machine Learning model as you do in every Machine Learning problem you solve. Once you have trained your model, below is the process you can follow to turn your Machine Learning model into an end-to-end solution using the dash framework:

1. Set up a new Dash application.
2. Create the layout of the app using Dashâ€™s HTML and Core Components. It includes input fields, buttons, and output display areas.
3. Write callback functions to define the interactivity of the app, such as taking user inputs, running the model prediction, and displaying the results.
4. Load the model within the app to use for predictions.

## Final Result
You have to enter the following to get the output :
- Distance to the nearest MRT station
- Number of convenience stores
- Latitude
- Longitude
